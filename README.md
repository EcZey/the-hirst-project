# Dot Pattern Generator

Welcome to the Dot Pattern Generator project! This project uses Python's `turtle` graphics library to create a colorful dot pattern on the screen. The pattern is generated based on a predefined list of RGB colors and is displayed in a grid-like formation.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python's `turtle` graphics library to draw a pattern of colorful dots. The dots are randomly colored from a predefined list of RGB values and are arranged in a grid. The turtle moves around the screen, placing dots at regular intervals to create the pattern.

## Features

- **Colorful Dot Pattern**: Generates a pattern of dots in a grid-like arrangement.
- **Random Colors**: Each dot is colored randomly from a predefined list of RGB values.
- **Grid Layout**: Dots are arranged in rows and columns to form a grid pattern.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `turtle` module (included with Python's standard library)
